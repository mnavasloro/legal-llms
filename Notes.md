- Langflow web editor
- 1. experiment: just dates
- Performance 
- Prompt engineering: how can we modify the prompt?
- Automatic evaluation of responses -> add them to the gate document and use gate for evaluation?
- Multi agent system: let the LLMs discuss with each other (like we did) and vote in the end

- second pass over results -> let LLM restructure it to make it more precise ("instruct" llm?)
