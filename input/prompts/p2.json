Events can be of type event_circumstance and event_procedure.",
    "instruction": "Analyze the provided text and extract the legal events. Provide the results in a structured format. Obviously, Event_who, Event_what and Event_when can only appear within an Event. If you find an event, also classify it into an event_circumstance or event_procedure. Do not invent additional information. Only extract information that is explicitly present in the text, hence, do not add any assumptions or interpretations beyond what is stated and also do not summarize text."
