Okay, so I need to extract all dates from this text. Let me read through each paragraph carefully.

First paragraph: It mentions an application number 11236/09 against Turkey with the Court under Article 34. The case was lodged on 17 February 2006. So that's one date, 17 February 2006.

Moving to the second paragraph: No specific dates mentioned here, just that Ms G. Tuncer is a lawyer practicing in Istanbul. Nothing else to extract.

Third paragraph: Applicant alleged issues with privacy during consultations and mentions Article 8. No new dates here either.

Fourth paragraph: Important date here is October 17, 2017, when notice of complaints was given. So that's another date, October 17, 2017.

Alright, so I need to extract all dates from the given text. Let me start by reading through each point carefully.

Point 1 mentions three applications against Ukraine. The first applicant, Mikhail Belyayev, lodged his application on 3 March 2010. The second applicant, Ivan Karpenko, applied on 16 August 2010. The third applicant, Rustam Farziyev, submitted his application on 28 October 2013.

Moving to Point 2, there's information about the lawyers representing each applicant and the Government's agent, but I don't see any dates here, so I can skip this point for now.

Point 4 is crucial because it mentions when notice of complaints was given. It states that on 16 May 2018, notice was provided to the Government and the rest of the applications were declared inadmissible under Rule 54 §3. Additionally, the Court rejected the Government's objection after considering it.

So, compiling all these dates: March 3, 2010; August 16, 2010; October 28, 2013; May 16, 2018.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to extract all the dates from this given text. The user provided a chunk of text with four points, each containing some information about a legal case involving the Federal Republic of Germany and a Turkish national named Yunus Cabucak. My task is to identify every date mentioned in this text.

First, I'll read through each point carefully. 

Point 1 mentions ""on 5 April 2016."" That's an obvious date. I'll note that down as the first date: 5th April 2016.

Moving on to Point 3, it says ""On 23 November 2016 the application was communicated to the Government."" So here, there are two dates mentioned: 23rd November 2016 and when exactly? Wait, let me check. It's only one date here: 23 November 2016.

Point 4 refers to Article 36 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court. There aren't any dates in this part beyond those already mentioned earlier.

I don't see any other dates in Points 2 or 4. So compiling all the dates I found: April 5, 2016, and November 23, 2016.

I should make sure there are no hidden dates in the text that might have been overlooked. Scanning through again, the only specific days mentioned are the ones I already listed. There's mention of ""Rule 44 of the Rules of Court,"" but since it doesn't specify a date, I don't include that as a date.

So, to summarize, there are two dates in total: April 5, 2016, and November 23, 2016.

Alright, so the user has given me a text with some dates and wants me to extract all the dates from it. Let me start by reading through each point carefully.

First, in point 1, I see ""on 19 October 2012."" That's definitely a date that needs extracting. The case number is mentioned too, but only the year there, so not relevant for extraction.

Moving on to point 2, it talks about lawyers and the government representation without any specific dates. So nothing to extract here except maybe the names, but I'm only focusing on dates right now.

Point 3 doesn't have any dates either; it's about the complaint under Article 8. No mention of when that happened, so no extraction needed there.

Now, point 4 is more informative. It says ""On 20 December 2012"" and then mentions the submission dates: 6 May 2013 for the government and 4 July 2013 for the applicants. These are all clear dates to extract.

I need to make sure I capture each occurrence of a date, whether it's in the main narrative or within the numbered points. Also, ensuring that I'm consistent with the format, probably using ISO 8601 for each date without any additional text.

The text has four points. Point 1 mentions a case originated in an application (no. 11800/10) against the Russian Federation. It was lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention on 17 January 2010.

Point 2 talks about the applicant being represented by Mr. E. Mezak, and the Russian Government being represented by Mr. G. Matyushkin. There's no date here except maybe in Point 1, but this seems more about people involved.

Point 3 is about the complaint regarding a ban on family visits for administrative detainees. No dates mentioned here either.

Point 4 says that on 17 June 2010, the application was communicated to the Government. Both parties submitted written observations, so another date here—17 June 2010.

Point 2 doesn't have any dates; it's about the applicant's representation and the government's agent, so nothing to extract there.

Moving to paragraph 2, there are no dates mentioned except in the context of lawyers and their representations, which doesn't add any new dates beyond what's already noted.

Paragraph 3 talks about the re-seizure happening on 7 March 2012. That's another date I need to include.

Alright, I need to figure out how to extract all dates from the given text. Let me read through each point carefully.

Starting with point 1: ""on 12 March 2015."" So that's one date—March 12, 2015.

Point 2 doesn't mention any specific dates, just mentions lawyers and representatives.

Point 3 says, ""On 7 November 2016."" That adds another date—November 7, 2016.

Point 4: ""on 6 September 2018."" So that's September 6, 2018.

I should list these dates clearly. They are all in the format of day month year, so I can present them as separate entries.

Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to extract all dates from a given text. The text is in four paragraphs, each containing some legal information related to a case before the European Court of Human Rights.

First, I need to read through each paragraph carefully and identify any date mentions. Let's take it step by step.

Paragraph 1 starts with ""on 16 October 2010."" That's definitely a date to extract. I'll note that as October 16, 2010.

Moving on to Paragraph 2, there's nothing obvious here except mentions of rules like Rule 36 and Rule 54. No dates in this part.

Paragraph 3 talks about the applicant's allegations but again, no dates are directly mentioned. It's more about the nature of his claims rather than specific timings.

Now, Paragraph 4 is interesting because it has two dates: ""On 5 November 2015"" and mentions that the application was declared inadmissible on that date. So, those are the key points here—November 5, 2015, and also potentially another date if there's a communication mentioned elsewhere, but I don't see any other dates in the text.

I should make sure to list all these dates clearly. The user didn't specify any particular format beyond extraction, so just listing them out numerically with the month and day should suffice.

Wait, let me double-check the text for any other hidden dates. Sometimes legal texts can have footnotes or references that include dates, but in this case, it seems only the two mentioned are present.

So, compiling all these together, I'll list October 16, 2010, and November 5, 2015, as the extracted dates from the text.

Here are all the dates extracted from the text:

1. **16 October 2010**  
   - Refers to the date on which the application (no. 66610/10) was lodged with the Court.

2. **5 November 2015**  
   - Refers to the date when the complaint concerning the alleged violation of the applicant’s right to respect for his home was communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.","16 October 2010
5 November 2015"
