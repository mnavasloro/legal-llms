Alright, so I need to help this user by analyzing a legal text and extracting specific events with their components: event_who, event_what, and event_when. Also, I have to classify each event into either event_circumstance or event_procedure.

First, let me read through the provided text carefully. The text is about a case before the Court, starting with an application against Turkey. There are four paragraphs, each containing some legal details.

Starting with paragraph 1: It mentions that the case originated from an application (numbered) by Mr. Mehmet Aytunç Altay on February 17, 2006. So here, the event_who is the applicant, which is clearly stated as ""the applicant."" The event_what would be ""lodged an application,"" since he's submitting it with the Court. The date is given as 17 February 2006, so event_when is straightforward.

Moving to paragraph 2: This one talks about the representation by a lawyer and the Government's agent. Here, the event_who seems to be the applicant again because they're represented by Ms. G. Tuncer. The event_what here would probably be ""was represented,"" but I'm not sure if that fits into event_what as defined. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the procedural aspect, so perhaps this is an event_procedure where the representation details are provided.

Paragraph 3: The applicant alleges privacy issues with his lawyer and domestic proceedings. Here, the event_who is still the applicant, alleging incompatibility with Article 8 and non-compliance with Article 6. So event_what would be ""alleged,"" but I need to see if it's about circumstances or procedure. Since it's about the facts he's bringing forward, maybe this is an event_circumstance.

Paragraph 4: This paragraph mentions notice given on October 17, 2017, and inadmissibility under Rule 54 §3. So event_who here would be the applicant again because they're the ones giving notice. The event_what is ""noticed"" or more accurately, since it's about the complaint being declared inadmissible, perhaps ""declared inadmissible."" The date is October 17, 2017, so event_when applies.

I'm a bit confused about paragraph 2. Is the representation an event? It might not be a traditional legal event but rather background information. Maybe it's part of the procedural setup, so event_procedure would make sense here because it's about how the case was handled procedurally, with representations from both sides.

Also, I need to ensure that each event is correctly classified. The first and fourth paragraphs are clear as event_circumstance because they're about the main actions taken by the applicant. The second might be event_procedure since it's about representation details, while the third is also about circumstances, so event_circumstance again.

I should structure this into separate events with their components and classifications. Let me double-check each point to make sure I'm not missing any details.

Alright, so I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events based on the given definitions. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, looking at the structure: there are five paragraphs in total. Each event should be identified within these paragraphs. The key components of an event are Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when. Additionally, each event needs to be classified as either an event_circumstance or event_procedure.

Starting with paragraph 1: It talks about three applications against Ukraine lodged with the Court. So, here, the applicants are Mr. Belyayev, Mr. Karpenko, and Mr. Farziyev. The actions they did were ""lodged"" applications. The dates of their respective applications are provided (3 March 2010, 16 August 2010, 28 October 2013). So, this seems like an event where three applicants lodged applications with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention. Since this is about the facts being judged, it's an event_circumstance.

Moving to paragraph 2: It mentions who represented each applicant and the Government. The applicants were lawyers, and the Government was represented by their Agent. This doesn't seem to be an event itself but rather information about participants, so maybe not a separate event unless it relates to procedural actions. But I think this is just background info, so perhaps no event here.

Paragraph 3: The applicants complained under specific articles of the Convention. So, they made complaints regarding discrimination in visiting rights for male and female life prisoners. Here, the Event_who would be the applicants, the Event_what is ""complained,"" but I need to check if there's a more specific verb. Since it's about making a complaint, it's similar to lodging, so maybe Event_what is ""made complaints."" The date isn't provided here; however, the notice of complaint was given on 16 May 2018 in paragraph 4, which might be the Event_when for this complaint. This seems like an event_circumstance because it relates to the facts under judgment.

Paragraph 4: On 16 May 2018, notice of complaints was given, and the remainder of applications was declared inadmissible. So, the Event_who here is the Court (declaring inadmissible), but perhaps more accurately, the Government objected. The action taken was declaring applications inadmissible, so Event_what would be ""declared inadmissible."" The date is 16 May 2018. Since this is a procedural action by the Court, it's an event_procedure.

Paragraph 5: The Government objected to examination by a Committee but provided no reasons. Then the Court rejected the objection. So here, the Event_who would be the Government objecting and then the Court rejecting. The actions are ""objected"" and ""rejected."" Since this is about procedural steps in handling objections, it's another event_procedure.

Now, compiling all events:

1. Three applicants lodged applications on specific dates.
2. Applicants made complaints under certain articles.
3. Notice of complaint given, and other apps declared inadmissible.
4. Government objected to examination.
5. Court rejected the objection.

Each of these has Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when, with classifications as event_circumstance or event_procedure based on whether they relate to the facts (circumstance) or procedural actions (procedure).

I need to make sure each event is properly structured, noting that not all paragraphs are events—only those where the action occurs. Also, in paragraph 3, I might have to infer the date as being 16 May 2018 since that's when notice was given, so perhaps the complaint event's Event_when is that date.

Wait, but the complaint itself happened earlier, but the notice was on 16 May. Maybe the complaint event doesn't have a specific date except in paragraph 4 where it's noticed. So, maybe the complaint is considered as an event with Event_what being ""made complaints"" and Event_when perhaps referencing when they were made (paragraph 3), but without specific dates, perhaps just leaving Event_when as unspecified or noting that the notice was on a later date.

I think I'll proceed by extracting each relevant action, assigning their components as best as possible.

Alright, I need to analyze the provided text and extract legal events based on the given definitions. Let me start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

Starting with paragraph 1: It mentions an application (no. 30315/10) against Ukraine filed by two individuals under Article 34 of the Convention. The applicants are referred to as Mr. Vyacheslav Bigun and Ms. Lesya Bigun, so I can note them as Event_who. The main action is ""lodged"" with the Court, which falls under Event_what. The date mentioned is May 12, 2010, so that's Event_when.

Moving to paragraph 2: It talks about representation by a lawyer and the Government's agent. Here, the applicants are again the subjects (Event_who). The main verb here is ""represented,"" which is part of the procedural aspect, so this should be classified under event_procedure.

Paragraph 3 mentions notice given to the Government on January 5, 2016. The notice relates to the application, so the Event_who includes the applicants and possibly the Government. The action is giving notice, which is a form of event (event_procedure).

Finally, paragraph 4 states that the Government didn't object to the examination by a Committee. Again, this is about procedural actions, so it's another event_procedure. 

I should structure each Event with its components: who, what, when, and then classify into either circumstance or procedure. Since these events pertain to the case handling process, they are procedural in nature.

Okay, so I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events based on the provided definitions. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The text is four paragraphs about a case in front of a court, likely the European Court of Human Rights since it mentions Article 34 of the Convention. The case involves Mr. Yunus Cabucak, a Turkish national applying against Germany due to his expulsion after criminal convictions for drug trafficking.

First, I need to identify the legal events. Each event should have Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when. Plus, classify each into either event_circumstance or event_procedure.

Looking at paragraph 1: It talks about the case originating from an application (no. 18706/16) against Germany by Mr. Cabucak on April 5, 2016. So, the first event is when the applicant lodged the application. The who is the applicant, the what is ""lodged an application,"" and the when is April 5, 2016. Since it's about the filing of a case, I think this falls under event_circumstance because it's about the facts under judgment.

Paragraph 2 mentions representation by lawyers on both sides—applicant's lawyer and German agents. This seems more procedural, like who was representing whom in court proceedings, so maybe that doesn't count as an event? Or is there a specific event here?

Wait, perhaps each mention of a legal action is an event. The communication of the application to the Government on November 23, 2016, in paragraph 3, seems like another event: who is the applicant, what is the application being communicated, when is November 23, 2016. That's about the facts (application), so event_circumstance.

Paragraph 4 says the Turkish Government didn't indicate wanting to intervene. So, who is the Turkish Government, what is not indicating intervention, when? The time isn't specified here, just that they didn't wish to exercise their right. This might relate to procedural steps in the case, like a right of intervention under Article 36. Maybe it's an event_procedure because it's about actions taken (or not taken) in the case.

Wait, but each Event is per paragraph? Or per occurrence?

Looking back at the instructions: Events can be of type event_circumstance or event_procedure. Each Event is within a single text section.

In paragraph 1: The origin of the case via application—Event_who: Mr Yunus Cabucak, Event_what: ""lodged an application,"" Event_when: April 5, 2016. Classification: event_circumstance because it's about the facts leading to the case.

Paragraph 2 is about representation—it might be more procedural but doesn't specify a time or action beyond that. Maybe not an event? Or maybe each instance of court actions counts as events.

But in paragraph 3, communication of application—Event: communicated, so Event_who: applicant, Event_what: communicated, Event_when: November 23, 2016. Classification: event_circumstance because it's part of the case's factual progression.

Paragraph 4 mentions Turkish Government not intervening. So Event_who: Turkish Government, Event_what: did not indicate wishing to exercise right, Event_when: not specified but can be noted as ""did not indicate..."". Classification: event_procedure because it's about procedural actions (or lack thereof) in the case.

I need to make sure each Event is a separate occurrence within their respective paragraphs. Also, ensure I'm not missing any other events.

Wait, paragraph 2 mentions both parties being represented—could that be an event? Maybe. The applicant was represented by Mr. Giebenrath, and Government by two agents. So, who: applicant and German Agents; what: were represented; when: the time isn't specified but it's a procedural matter, so perhaps an event_procedure.

But each Event needs to be within its own paragraph or section? Or can they span multiple paragraphs if necessary?

I think each paragraph is a separate text unit. So, in paragraph 1, I have one Event; paragraph 2 may contain another Event about representation; but since it's procedural, maybe that counts as event_procedure. Similarly, paragraphs 3 and 4 also contain events.

Wait, the initial example response only found three Events: two from paragraphs 1 and 3, and one from paragraph 4. Maybe each significant action in a paragraph is an Event.

So summarizing:

Paragraph 1: Applicant lodges application (event_circumstance)
Paragraph 2: Applicant's rep & Government's reps (maybe event_procedure about representation)
Paragraph 3: Application communicated (event_circumstance)
Paragraph 4: Turkish Gov't didn't indicate intervention (event_procedure)

But in the response, only three Events were identified. Maybe each Event is a unique action within a paragraph.

So perhaps:

1. Applicant lodged application (paragraph 1)
2. Communication of application (paragraph 3)
3. Turkish Gov't not indicating intervention (paragraph 4)

And representation is more about participants rather than events.

Alternatively, if each paragraph is treated as a separate text unit, then each can contribute one Event.

Thus, I think the correct approach is to have three Events: from paragraphs 1, 3, and 4. Each classified appropriately.

Okay, so I need to analyze the given legal text and extract the events based on the provided structure. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll read through each paragraph carefully. The user has provided three paragraphs, and each one seems to contain information about a legal case, specifically an application against Turkey.

Starting with the first paragraph: It mentions that the case originated from an application number 2437/08. The applicant is Ms. Zeliha Eylem Can, who lodged the application on 4 January 2008 under Article 34 of the Convention. Here, I can identify an event where the applicant is the subject (event_who), the action is lodging an application (event_what), and the date is 4 January 2008 (event_when). Since this relates to the circumstances of the case, it should be classified under event_circumstance.

Moving to the second paragraph: It talks about representation. The applicant was represented by Mr. Y. Alataş, while the Government had their Agent. This seems to describe procedural actions, like having legal representatives, so I'll classify this as an event_procedure. The subject is the parties involved (applicant and Government), but since the main action here isn't a single event but rather ongoing representation, I might need to structure it differently. Wait, perhaps each mention of representation is part of the procedural setup, not a standalone event. Maybe this isn't an event itself but context about the case's procedure.

The third paragraph discusses a complaint being communicated on 6 January 2014 and the remainder of the application declared inadmissible under Rule 54 §3. This seems like another event where the complaint is communicated (event_what), happening on that date. The subject would be the Court or the applicant, but more accurately, it's the communication action by the Court to the Government. Since this is about the processing of the case and a decision made, it falls under event_circumstance.

Wait, I need to make sure each event has event_who, event_what, and event_when. In the first paragraph, we had one clear event. The second paragraph mentions representation but doesn't specify a specific action, so maybe there isn't an event here. Or perhaps it's about the procedural setup, which can be classified as event_procedure without being tied to a specific event.

In the third paragraph, the complaint communication is another event, with its own subject (the Court), verb (communicated the complaint), and date. So that should be an event_circumstance because it's part of the case's factual circumstances.

I also need to ensure I don't have overlapping events or misclassify any parts. The second paragraph might not contribute a separate event as it describes ongoing representation, which is procedural but not a specific event within the text provided.

So, in summary:

1. Application lodged by Ms. Can on 4 Jan 2008 – event_circumstance.
2. Representation by Mr. Alataş and Government Agent – possibly no standalone event unless there's a specific action mentioned here, which there isn't, so maybe only procedural context.
3. Communication of complaint on 6 Jan 2014 – event_circumstance.

I should present these events clearly with their respective classifications.

1. **Event 1:**
   - **event_who:** Ms. Zeliha Eylem Can (Applicant)

2. **Event 2:**
   - **No standalone event identified in the second paragraph as it describes procedural context without specific actions.**

Okay, I need to analyze the provided text and extract legal events based on the given definitions. Let me go through each sentence step by step.

The first sentence says that the case originated in an application (no. 6221/14) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention by a Romanian national, Mr. Cristian Cătălin Ungureanu on November 25, 2013. So here, the main event is the lodging of an application. The subject (who) is Mr. Ungureanu, the action (what) is lodging the application, and the date (when) is November 25, 2013. This event seems to be about the circumstances of the case, as it's the origin of the legal proceedings.

The second sentence mentions that the applicant was represented by a lawyer, while the Government was represented by their Agent. I think this isn't an event because it doesn't describe a main action but rather who is representing whom. So, maybe no event here.

The third sentence talks about the applicant's allegations related to personal relations and excessive proceedings. This seems more like the content of the case rather than an event. The allegations are part of the circumstances, so they might be classified under event_circumstance.

The fourth sentence states that on September 16, 2014, the application was communicated to the Government. Here, the subject is the applicant (but actually, in this context, it's the Court communicating), the action is communicating the application, and the date is September 16, 2014. This seems like a procedural event because it's about how the case is being handled by the court.

Wait, but in the first sentence, the applicant lodged the application on Nov 25, 2013. The fourth sentence mentions that this application was communicated to the Government on Sept 16, 2014. So each of these can be separate events.

So summarizing:
- Event 1: Applicant lodging the application (circumstance)
- Event 2: Communication of application (procedure)

I need to ensure I correctly identify the subject (who), action (what), and date (when) for each event, then classify them as circumstance or procedure.

Alright, so I need to analyze the provided text and extract legal events based on the given definitions. The text has four paragraphs, each dealing with a case against the Republic of Bulgaria. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

First, in paragraph 1, it mentions an application (no. 15074/08) filed under Article 34 of the Convention. The applicant is Mr. Tsanko Todorov Doktorov, and he lodged this on February 18, 2008. Here, I should note that the event_who is the applicant, the event_what is ""lodge(d)"" an application, and the event_when is the date, February 18, 2008. Since it's about filing a case, this seems like an event_circumstance because it's about the facts under judgment.

Moving to paragraph 2, Mr. Valchev represents the applicant, while Ms. Nikolova represents the Bulgarian Government. This isn't directly an event but mentions representatives, so maybe not relevant for extraction as per instructions.

Paragraph 3 details the applicant's allegations regarding paternity issues. Again, this is more about the facts he presented, which falls under event_circumstance as it relates to the case's content.

In paragraph 4, on December 7, 2016, the complaint was communicated, and the application was declared inadmissible under Rule 54 §3. Here, the event_who is either the applicant or the Government, but since it's about the court's decision, I think the core event is that the application became inadmissible. The event_what would be ""declared inadmissible,"" and the date is December 7, 2016. This seems like an event_procedure because it's about how the case was processed.

I need to ensure each event has all three components: who, what, when. Also, classify them into circumstance or procedure. The first event is definitely a circumstance as it's the origin of the case. The last event in paragraph 4 is procedural since it's about court actions. The allegations in paragraph 3 might be part of the same initial case, so I'll include that as another event_circumstance.

Wait, but in the second paragraph, there are two representations mentioned. Should these be considered events? Probably not, because they don't fit into who, what, when structure in a way that defines an event as per the definitions. So, only the first and fourth paragraphs contribute to extractable events.

Okay, so I have this task where I need to analyze some legal text and extract events based on specific categories: Event_who, Event_what, Event_when, and then classify each event into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided four sentences from a legal case. I need to go through each sentence and identify events. Each event should include who (Event_who), what (Event_what), when (Event_when), and then classification into circumstance or procedure.

Looking at the first sentence: ""The case originated in an application (no. 31221/15) against the Republic of Iceland lodged with the Court under Article 34... by an Icelandic national, Mr Egill Einarsson ('the applicant'), on 16 June 2015.""

So, the main event here is the lodging of an application. The subject is the applicant, Mr. Egill Einarsson. The action taken is 'lodged an application.' The date is 16 June 2015. Now, I need to classify this. Since it's about submitting a case to the court, it's more procedural because it relates to how the case started procedurally.

Moving on to the second sentence: ""The applicant was represented by Mr Vilhjálmur H. Vilhjálmsson... The Icelandic Government were represented by their Agent...""

This seems like an event where the applicant and the government are being represented, but I'm not sure if this counts as a legal event in the defined sense. The main events are about actions like lodging applications or court decisions, so maybe this isn't an event to extract here.

Third sentence: ""The applicant complained, under Article 8... that the domestic courts’ judgments had entailed a violation of his right to respect for his private life.""

Here, the applicant is making a complaint. The action is 'complained,' and the subject is the applicant. The date isn't explicitly given, but since it's part of the same case, maybe I can infer the date from earlier? Wait, no, it's better to note that the when might be implied. As for classification, this seems like a circumstance because it's describing the facts the applicant is raising.

Fourth sentence: ""On 14 November 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.""

This event is about communicating the application to the government. The subject is the Court (implicitly), the action is 'communicated,' and the date is 14 November 2016. This seems procedural because it's a step in the case handling process.

So, summarizing the events I found:
1. Applicant lodged an application on 16 June 2015 (procedural).
2. Complained about violation of private life (circumstance).

I think that's all. Wait, but in the second sentence, are there multiple events? Maybe representing isn't an event unless it's part of a procedural step. Probably not necessary to extract it as an event here.

Alright, so I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the text carefully. The case originated from an application against Norway, specifically mentioning the number and the date when it was lodged. It's under Article 34 of the Convention, filed by Mona Høiness on June 3, 2014. So, that seems like a clear event: someone (the applicant) did something (lodged an application) on a specific date.

Next, looking at the second paragraph, there are mentions of representatives: Mr. Helle representing the applicant and the Norwegian Government with their agents. This doesn't directly mention another event beyond the initial application, so maybe not much to extract here except confirming who's involved.

The third paragraph talks about the applicant's allegations regarding her rights under Article 8. It's more about her claims rather than an action or event, so this might be part of the circumstance but not a separate event itself.

Then there's the fourth paragraph where notice was given on June 20, 2017. This is another event: someone (the Government) was notified about the application. So that's another event with its own subject, verb, and date.

Now, classifying each event into either circumstance or procedure. The first event is the applicant lodging an application, which is a procedural step in initiating a case. The second event is giving notice, also a procedural action. The third point about allegations isn't an event but part of the circumstances because it's detailing her claims.

I think I've got two events here. Let me structure them properly with their components.

Alright, I need to analyze the provided legal text and extract the legal events as per the given structure. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

Starting with paragraph 1: It mentions that the case originated in an application numbered 69489/12 against the Republic of Lithuania. The applicants are four Lithuanian nationals who lodged this application on 19 October 2012 under Article 34 of the Convention. So, here, the main event is the filing of an application. The Event_who would be the applicants and possibly the respondent as the opposing party. The Event_what is ""lodged an application,"" and Event_when is 19 October 2012. Since this is about the circumstances of the case, it should be classified under event_circumstance.

Moving to paragraph 2: This part talks about the representation by lawyers and the Government's agent. It doesn't directly mention any events beyond the previous one. So, I don't think there are new events here. However, this information is procedural as it relates to who is representing whom in the case.

Paragraph 3: The applicants complain under Article 8 of the Convention about Lithuanian law discouraging healthcare professionals from assisting them during childbirth. This seems like another event where the applicants raised a specific issue. So, Event_who would be the applicants, Event_what is ""complained,"" and Event_when isn't explicitly stated here, so maybe it's general or implied when they submitted their application. The complaint relates to the circumstances of the case, hence event_circumstance.

Paragraph 4: This part details the communication and submissions by both parties on specific dates. On 20 December 2012, the application was communicated, and later, the Government submitted observations on 6 May 2013, followed by applicants on 4 July 2013. Each of these actions is an event. The first event is communication, so Event_who is the Court communicating to the Government, Event_what is ""communicated,"" Event_when is 20 December 2012. This seems procedural as it's about the case proceedings. Then, the Government submits observations on 6 May 2013, which is another event under Event_what ""submitted observations."" This is also procedural.

The applicants submitting their observations on 4 July 2013 is another event, classified as procedural since it's part of the case handling process.

I should make sure each identified event has all three components: who, what, when. Also, classify them correctly into circumstance or procedure based on their nature.

Let me know if you need further clarification or analysis!","<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract legal events from this provided text. Let me read through it again and see what each part is talking about.

The first paragraph says that the case originated in an application number 4587/09 against the Russian Federation. The applicants are Mr. Andrey Lozovoy and Ms. Tamara Lozovaya, who lodged the application with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention on November 10, 2008.

So, the first event here is about the applicants lodging an application. That sounds like an Event_what: ""lodged an application."" The Event_who would be the applicants, and the Event_when is November 10, 2008.

The second paragraph mentions that the Russian Government was represented by Mr. G. Matyushkin initially and then by Mr. M. Galperin. This seems like a separate event about the government being represented. So, the Event_what here is ""were represented."" The Event_who is the Russian Government, and there's no specific date mentioned, so Event_when might be considered as ongoing or not applicable.

The third paragraph talks about the applicants complaining about the domestic authorities' failure to notify them of their son’s death. This is another event where the applicants are taking an action (complaining). So, Event_what is ""complained,"" Event_who is the applicants, and again, no specific date, so Event_when might be considered as when they did this.

The fourth paragraph mentions that on June 8, 2010, the application was communicated to the Government. The parties also submitted written observations on admissibility and merits. So, here we have another event where the application is communicated. Event_what: ""was communicated,"" Event_who is the Government, and Event_when is June 8, 2010.

Now, I need to classify these events into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. The first event (application) seems like a procedural step in initiating a case, so that would be event_procedure. The second event about representation is also procedural as it's part of the case handling process. The third event, complaining, might be a circumstance because it describes the facts under judgment. The fourth event of communication is another procedural step.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if all these are correctly classified. Maybe I should double-check each one.

Looking again:

1. Application: Procedural, yes.
2. Representation: Also procedural since it's about how the case is handled.
3. Complaining: This is more about the facts (circumstance) rather than a procedural step.
4. Communication of application: Definitely procedural as it's part of the process.

So, my initial assessment seems correct. Now, I need to present this in a structured format with all the required fields and classifications.

Here is the structured extraction of legal events from the provided text:

1. **Event 1**:
   - Event_who: Applicants (Andrey Mikhaylovich Lozovoy and Tamara Vasilyevna Lozovaya)

Note that some information, such as the representation of the applicant and the Government by their respective lawyers and agents, is not classified as a separate event as it does not contain a clear ""event_what"" (main verb) component. Similarly, Event 3's ""Event_when"" is not specified in the text, so it is left as ""Not specified"".","<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract legal events with specific annotations. They also want these events classified into event_circumstance or event_procedure.

First, I need to understand what each annotation means. Event_who is the subject involved, like applicant or respondent. Event_what is the main action, such as lodging an application or deciding something. Event_when refers to the date or time of the event.

Looking at the text, it's about a case that originated from an application. The first sentence mentions someone named Mr M.T., who is the applicant, and he lodged the application on 20 December 2016. That seems like a clear event with event_who as Mr M.T., event_what as lodging an application, and event_when as 20 Dec 2016.

The next sentences talk about representation. The applicant's lawyer is mentioned, but that's more of a detail rather than the main event. Similarly, the Government being represented doesn't form a separate legal event unless it's directly involved in an action.

Then there's the complaint under specific articles, which is another event where the applicant complains about domestic courts not establishing paternity. So here, event_who would still be Mr M.T., event_what is complaining or making a case under those articles, and event_when could be the same as the application date since it's part of the same case.

The last sentence is about giving notice to the Government on 20 March 2017. That’s another event where the applicant gives notice, so event_who is Mr M.T., event_what is giving notice, and event_when is 20 Mar 2017.

Now, classifying these events: The first two seem like they are circumstances because they describe the facts of the case—applying for protection and complaining about domestic issues. The third event is procedural since it's about giving notice, which is part of the case procedure.

I should structure this by listing each event with their respective annotations and then categorize them. Making sure not to include any extra info beyond what's given in the text.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Let me lay it out step by step.
</think>

Let’s analyze the provided text and extract legal events accordingly:

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this legal text and extract the events properly. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each event component entails. There's Event_who, which is the subject of the event—could be a person like an applicant or respondent, but also things like applications. Then there's Event_what, which is the main action, like ""lodged"" or ""decided."" Event_when would be the date or time reference.

I also need to classify each event into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. Circumstance relates to the facts being judged, and procedure is about how the case is processed.

Looking at the first paragraph, it talks about an application (no. 44045/05) against Russia by Mr. Moskalev on October 27, 2005. So here, the Event_who would be ""Mr Yuriy Ivanovich Moskalev"" as the applicant and also ""the Russian Federation."" The action is that he lodged an application, so Event_what is ""lodged."" Event_when is straightforward—it happened on Oct 27, 2005.

Next, it mentions the Government being represented by certain people. This seems like a procedural step, maybe part of the case handling, so this would be event_procedure.

The applicant's allegations are about surveillance—this relates to the facts (circumstance), so event_circumstance applies here.

Finally, the application was communicated on March 20, 2009. So again, Event_who is the applicant, Event_what is ""communicated,"" and it's an event_procedure because it's part of processing the case.

I need to make sure each event has all three components: who, what, when. Also, check if they are circumstances or procedures.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract legal events from this text based on the given definitions. Let me start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

The first paragraph talks about the case originating in an application, specifically no. 62526/15. The applicant is Ms. Leyla Khamarzovna Muruzheva, who lodged the application with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention on December 11, 2015. So here, I can identify an event where the who is the applicant, the what is ""lodged an application,"" and the when is December 11, 2015. Since this is about the procedural aspect of initiating a case, it's likely an event_procedure.

Moving on to paragraph two, it mentions that the applicant was represented by certain lawyers, while the Russian Government had representatives who changed. This seems more like administrative details about the parties involved rather than an event itself. So maybe there are no new events here beyond what's already mentioned.

Paragraph three discusses the applicant's complaint regarding the failure to enforce a previous judgment. The main action here is the complaint, so the who would be the applicant, the what could be ""complained"" or more specifically, ""complained about the authorities’ failure."" However, since there's no specific date or temporal reference, I'm not sure how to assign an event_when. Also, it doesn't specify if this is a circumstance or procedure, but it seems like it's part of the case's circumstances.

Paragraph four mentions that the application was communicated to the Government on April 25, 2016. Here, the who is the applicant (or the Court communicating), the what is ""communicated the application,"" and the when is April 25, 2016. This seems like an event_procedure as it's part of the procedural steps in handling the case.

So putting this together, I have two main events: one from December 11, 2015, about lodging the application, and another on April 25, 2016, about communicating the application. The complaint in paragraph three doesn't fit neatly into an event without a specific date, so maybe it's not classified as an event but rather as part of the case's circumstances.

I need to make sure I'm only extracting events with who, what, when. Also, each event should be categorized as either circumstance or procedure based on its nature. Since both identified events are about procedural actions (lodging and communication), they fall under event_procedure. The complaint is more of a factual statement without an explicit action date, so it might not qualify as an event.

I should structure the output clearly with each event having their respective components and classifications.
</think>

Here is the structured analysis of the legal events extracted from the provided text:

1. **Event 1: Lodging of Application**
   - **event_who**: Ms Leyla Khamarzovna Muruzheva (the applicant)
   - **event_what**: Lodged an application
   - **event_when**: 11 December 2015
   - **Classification**: event_procedure

2. **Event 2: Communication of Application**
   - **event_who**: The applicant (by the Court)
   - **event_what**: Communicated the application
   - **event_when**: 25 April 2016
   - **Classification**: event_procedure

The complaint mentioned in paragraph three is not classified as an event due to the absence of a specific temporal reference, thus it's considered part of the case's circumstances without being a separate event.

Alright, I need to analyze the provided legal text and extract the events based on the given definitions. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

Starting with paragraph 1: It mentions an application (no. 38647/09) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention by Mr. Gábor Ónodi. Here, the event is the lodging of an application. The subject (Event_who) is the applicant, who is Mr. Gábor Ónodi. The main action (Event_what) is ""lodged,"" and it happened on 16 July 2009 (Event_when). Since this seems to be about the filing of a case, I classify this as an event_procedure because it's related to the procedural aspect of initiating a case.

Moving to paragraph 2: It talks about the applicant being represented by Ms. M. Regász and the Hungarian Government by Mr. Z. Tallódi. This seems more like introductory information about the parties involved rather than a specific legal event. Therefore, I don't extract any events from this part.

Paragraph 3: The applicant alleges that Hungarian authorities breached Article 8 of the Convention regarding contact with his daughter. Here, the event is the allegation or complaint made by the applicant. The Event_who is the applicant, the Event_what could be ""alleged"" or ""made a complaint,"" and the timeframe isn't explicitly stated beyond being communicated later. Since this relates to the facts of the case (the circumstances), I classify it as event_circumstance.

Paragraph 4: On 14 March 2016, the Government was informed, and the rest of the application was declared inadmissible under Rule 54 § 3. This is a court decision, so Event_who is the Court, though typically not listed, but the action (Event_what) is ""declared inadmissible."" The date is 14 March 2016. This event is procedural since it's about the processing of the case.

Putting it all together, I have three events: the lodging of the application, the allegation/complaint, and the declaration of inadmissibility.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text and wants me to extract legal events with specific annotations: event_who, event_what, and event_when. They also want these events classified as either event_circumstance or event_procedure.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully to identify each event. Each event should be within parentheses using the specified format.

Looking at paragraph 1, the application was made by Ms O.C.I. on behalf of herself and her children. The key action here is ""lodged an application,"" so Event_who would be the applicants (Ms O.C.I., N.A.R., P.A.R.), Event_what is ""lodged an application,"" and Event_when is 23 June 2017. Since this is about the factual circumstances of the case, it's classified as event_circumstance.

Next, paragraph 2 mentions the representation by Mr A. Amuza. The action here is the applicants being represented, so Event_who is Mr A. Amuza, Event_what is ""represented by,"" but since it's about representation, I think the main verb is more about acting on behalf, so maybe ""acted as counsel."" However, the user might consider this as a procedural step, hence event_procedure.

Paragraph 3 talks about the Italian Government being notified of their right to intervene. The key action here is notification, so Event_who is the Italian Government, Event_what is ""notified under,"" and Event_when is when they were notified. This seems to be a procedural step as it relates to case progression, so event_procedure.

Paragraph 4 mentions notice given to the Government on 13 February 2018. The main action is giving notice, so Event_who is the applicants, Event_what is ""gave notice,"" and Event_when is the date. This is a procedural step since it's about case actions, so event_procedure.

Finally, paragraph 5 discusses the Court rejecting the Government’s objection. The key verb here is ""rejects,"" so Event_who is the Government, Event_what is ""rejected,"" and Event_when could be when they rejected it. This is a procedural step as it's about how the case is processed, hence event_procedure.

I need to make sure each event is correctly tagged with its type. I'll list them all in the required format without adding extra info beyond what's given.

Alright, so I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events using the provided definitions. Let me start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

The first paragraph mentions that the case originated in an application number 22743/07 against the Republic of Moldova. The applicant is Ms. Svetlana Otgon, who lodged the application on April 20, 2007. So here, the event_who would be Ms. Svetlana Otgon, and the event_what is 'lodged an application'. The date, April 20, 2007, falls under event_when.

Next, paragraph two talks about the Moldovan Government being represented by Mr. V. Grosu as their agent. This seems like another event where the who is the Government and the what is 'were represented by...'. However, since this isn't directly related to the main application but rather to the representation in court, I need to classify it correctly. It might be an event_procedure because it's about how the case was handled.

Paragraph three describes the applicant's allegations of insufficient compensation under Article 8. Here, the event_who is again Ms. Otgon, and the event_what is 'alleged...', so that's part of the main application. The event_circumstance would be her specific claim about the compensation. 

The fourth paragraph mentions that on November 30, 2009, the application was communicated to the Government. So event_who is the applicant, event_what is 'communicated', and the date is when it happened. This seems like a procedural step in the case, so it's an event_procedure.

I need to ensure each event is correctly classified as either circumstance or procedure. The main application (paragraph 1) is an event_circumstance because it's the underlying fact being adjudicated. The communication of the application (paragraph 4) is a procedural step, hence event_procedure.

Wait, in paragraph two, when the Government was represented, that's part of the case's procedural handling, so yes, event_procedure makes sense there too.

I think I've covered all events and correctly annotated them. Let me make sure each part is filled out properly with who, what, when, and their classifications.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract legal events from this text. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each event component is: Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when. Also, each event can be classified into either an event_circumstance or event_procedure.

Looking at the first sentence: ""The case originated in an application (no. 11800/10) against the Russian Federation..."" Here, the applicant is Mr. Andrey Aleksandrovich Pakhtusov. So, Event_who is the applicant. The main action here is that he applied, so Event_what would be ""lodged an application."" Since it's about starting a case, I think this falls under event_circumstance because it's about the factual basis of the case.

Next sentence: ""The applicant was represented by Mr E. Mezak..."" Here, the subject is the applicant again, but now the action is being represented. So Event_who is still the applicant. The Event_what would be ""represented by."" But wait, this seems more like a procedural step, so maybe it's an event_procedure.

Moving on: ""The Russian Government... were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin..."" Here, the subject is the Russian Government, and they are being represented. So Event_who is the Russian Government. The Event_what is ""represented by,"" but this seems like another procedural step. So I'll classify this as event_procedure.

Next, the applicant complained about a ban on family visits for administrative detainees. Here, Event_who is the applicant again, and Event_what is ""complained about."" This is about the facts of the case, so it's an event_circumstance.

Finally: ""On 17 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government..."" The subject here is the application, so Event_who would be the application. But wait, in the definitions, Event_who can also include objects like applications. So yes, that works. The Event_what is ""communicated to,"" and since this is a procedural step, it's event_procedure.

I need to make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Each sentence should be parsed for an event with the three components. Also, each event needs classification into circumstance or procedure. Let me check if I missed anything.
</think>

Here is the structured analysis of the extracted legal events:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract legal events from this provided text. The user wants me to identify Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when for each event, and also classify them into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. Let's go step by step.

First, I need to understand what a legal event is based on the definitions given. An event relates to the context of text containing information about an event. It has three components: who (subject), what (main action), and when (date). Additionally, it can be classified as either an event_circumstance or event_procedure.

Looking at the first paragraph:

""The case originated in an application (no. 47056/11) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Ms Marina Stanislavovna Panyushkina (“the first applicant”) and Mr Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Panyushkin (“the second applicant”), on 20 May 2011.""

Here, the main event is the lodging of an application. The subject is the applicants (Ms M.S. Panyushkina and Mr V.A. Panyushkin). The action is ""lodged"" an application, so Event_what would be ""lodged an application."" The date is 20 May 2011, so Event_when is that day.

Since this is about the filing of a case, it's a procedural event because it relates to the initiation of the legal proceeding. So, Event_type is both circumstance and procedure.

Moving on to the second paragraph:

""The applicants were represented by Ms O.P. Tseytlina, a lawyer practising in St Petersburg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.""

This doesn't seem to contain an event as defined because it's about representations by lawyers and government officials. It's more about parties in the case, not an event with a specific action, time, or circumstance.

Third paragraph:

""The applicants alleged that their right to respect for their home had been violated.""

Again, this is an allegation within the application, so it's part of the original claim. However, it doesn't specify when this happened, so without Event_when, it might not qualify as a separate event. Plus, it's about the factual basis (circumstance) of the case but not an action or procedural step.

Fourth paragraph:

""On 19 September 2016 the complaint concerning the alleged violation of the applicants’ right to respect for their home was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.""

Here, the event is that on 19 Sept 2016, a communication occurred. The subject is the complaint (the applicants' case). The action is ""communicated"" to the Government, so Event_what would be ""communicated."" The date is given as 19 September 2016.

This seems like a procedural step because it's about the processing of the application, specifically its communication and inadmissibility decision. So, Event_type is both circumstance and procedure.

Wait, but the first paragraph was about the origin of the case through an application, which was also classified as both types. The fourth paragraph is similar, dealing with the next step in the procedural handling of the case.

So, summarizing:

1. Application lodged on 20 May 2011 by applicants.
2. Communication of complaint to Government and inadmissibility decision on 19 Sept 2016.

I think that's two events. The second event is the communication and inadmissibility, which falls under procedural as it's part of case handling.

Okay, so I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events based on the definitions provided. The user has given me a structured text with four paragraphs, each containing information related to a case. My task is to identify the legal events within each paragraph and classify them into either event_circumstance or event_procedure.

First, I should read through each paragraph carefully to spot any key actions that involve Event_who (subject), Event_what (main verb or action), and Event_when (date). Also, each identified event needs to be classified further.

Starting with the first paragraph: It mentions an application number 9348/14 against the Russian Federation. The applicant is Mr. Andrey Igorevich Resin who lodged the application on December 17, 2013. So here, the main action is the lodging of the application, which would be Event_what. The subject is the applicant, so Event_who, and the date is given as Event_when.

Next, the second paragraph talks about representation. The applicant is represented by Mr. A. Molostov, while the Government changes their representatives from Mr. G. Matyushkin to Mr. M. Galperin. This seems like a procedural action, maybe related to the case's progression, so this might fall under event_procedure.

The third paragraph states the complaint about excessive restrictions on family visits. Here, the applicant is raising an issue, so this could be another instance where the main verb is lodging or complaining, making it another legal event, perhaps also classified as event_circumstance since it's a factual assertion.

Moving to the fourth paragraph: The Government was given notice on March 17, 2017, and the rest of the application was declared inadmissible under Rule 54 §3. So, the main action is that the Government received notice and acted by declaring inadmissibility. Here, Event_who would be the Government, Event_what is being given notice and then taking an action (declaring inadmissible), and the date is March 17, 2017. This seems procedural since it's about the case processing.

I need to ensure each event is captured correctly, only within each paragraph where applicable. Also, I should avoid adding any extra information beyond what's given. Each identified event must have Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when at minimum, along with a classification.

Let me structure this by going through each paragraph again:

1. Application lodged by Mr. Resin on Dec 17, 2013. Main action is lodging, so that's the event here.

2. Change in representation: The Government changing their representatives falls under procedural actions as it relates to case handling.

3. Complaint about family visits: This is another legal event where the applicant raises an issue, which I'll classify as circumstance since it's a factual complaint.

4. Notice given and inadmissibility declared: This is procedural, as it's part of the court process.

I should make sure not to repeat events across paragraphs unless they're separate instances. Each paragraph can have multiple events if there are multiple actions.

So, compiling all this together, I'll list each event with its details and classification.

Here is the analysis of the legal text, identifying the events and their respective components:

Alright, I'm trying to help this user who's asked me to extract legal events from a given text. Let me start by understanding what they need.

So, the user is an expert in legal text analysis and has provided definitions for each part of the event: Event_who, Event_what, Event_when, Event_circumstance, and Event_procedure. Each event must include these three annotations, and I also need to classify the event into either circumstance or procedure.

Looking at the text they provided, it's about a court case involving an applicant against Russia. The case number is 11467/15, filed on February 20, 2015. The first sentence mentions that the applicant requested not to have her name disclosed, and the President of the Section acceded to that request.

I'll start by identifying each event in the text. The first event seems to be about the lodging of the application. Here, the applicant is the subject (Event_who), the action is ""lodged an application"" (Event_what), and the date is February 20, 2015 (Event_when). Since this relates to the filing of the case, it's a procedural event.

Next, there's a notification by the applicant's representative about a name change. The Event_who here would be the applicant. The Event_what includes both notifying the Court and the Court processing under the initials. The date is July 10, 2017, so that's Event_when. This seems like part of the procedural handling of the case, hence another procedural event.

Then, there are mentions of the representatives: Memorial Human Rights Centre and European Human Rights Advocacy Centre. These are the legal teams involved, but they don't directly form an event on their own. The Government's representation is also noted, with two people mentioned. Again, these are part of the procedural setup but not specific events.

Finally, there's a declaration of inadmissibility on November 18, 2016. Here, Event_who is the applicant, Event_what is the communication and declaration, and the date is November 18, 2016. This seems to be a key procedural step, so it's another procedural event.

I need to make sure I'm only capturing events that are mentioned in the text and not adding anything extra. Each event should have clear annotations without any invented info. Also, each event's classification as circumstance or procedure must fit the context properly.

Also, I did not invent any additional information and only extracted the data that is explicitly mentioned in the text.","<think>
Alright, I need to analyze this legal text and extract the relevant events. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

Starting with paragraph 1: It mentions an application number 55216/08 against the Italian Republic. The applicant is Ms S.V., an Italian national who lodged the application on November 13, 2008. The Court President agreed not to disclose her identity under Rule 47 §4. 

For event extraction:
- Event_who: The subject is Ms S.V. (applicant) and the Court President.
- Event_what: The main action here is the lodging of an application by Ms S.V. against the Italian Republic, and the decision by the Court President regarding disclosure. So, I'll include both the lodging and the decision as separate events but linked as part of the same procedural actions.

Event classification:
- Since this event relates to the filing of a case (application), it falls under event_circumstance because it's about the facts of the case being brought.
- Also, the Court President's action is procedural in nature, so another event_procedure here.

Moving to paragraph 2: It talks about the applicant's representation by lawyers and the Italian Government's representation. 

Event extraction:
- The main subject here is the applicant and the Government. Their representations are about legal proceedings.
- Event_what would be their being represented by counsel. So, each has an event with who (applicant and Government) and what (represented by De Stefano/Guercio and Spatafora).

Event classification:
- These are procedural actions since they involve participation in the case's proceeding.

Paragraph 3: The Government was given notice of the application on March 20, 2016. 

Event extraction:
- Event_who: Italian Government
- Event_what: Given notice of application
- Event_when: March 20, 2016

Classification:
- Notice is part of procedural steps, so event_procedure.

Paragraph 4: NGOs were given leave to intervene on September 19, 2016. 

Event extraction:
- Event_who: NGOs (Alliance Defending Freedom and Unione Giuristi Cattolici Italiani)
- Event_what: Given leave to intervene
- Event_when: September 19, 2016

Classification:
- Intervening is part of the procedural aspects, hence event_procedure.

Note that I have only extracted events that are explicitly mentioned in the text and have not invented any additional information. Also, I have classified each event as either an `event_circumstance` or `event_procedure` based on its content.","<think>
Okay, so I have this task where I need to analyze a given legal text and extract specific events based on defined categories: Event_who, Event_what, Event_when, plus classification into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. 

First, let me understand the text provided:

1. The case originated in an application (no. 69820/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention by two applicants on 4 November 2010.
2. Applicants were represented by a lawyer, and the Government had two representatives who changed.
3. Applicants alleged violation of their right to respect for their home.
4. On 21 September 2015, the complaint was communicated to the Government, and the rest of the application was declared inadmissible.

Now, I need to extract events from this text. Each event should have at least Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when. Additionally, each event can be classified as either event_circumstance or event_procedure.

Starting with paragraph 1: The case originated in an application. Here, the application is the main event. So, Event_who would be the applicants (two Russian nationals). Event_what is ""lodged an application."" Event_when is November 4, 2010. Since this is about the initiation of the case, it's a procedural event because it's about filing the case.

Moving to paragraph 2: The applicants were represented by their lawyer. This seems like another event where the applicants are the who, doing the act of being represented (Event_what), but I don't see a specific date here. However, since this is about representation, which is part of the procedural process, it's an event_procedure.

Paragraph 3: Applicants alleged a rights violation. The who is the applicants; the what is ""alleged."" Since there's no date here, Event_when might be absent. But I think this could be classified as event_circumstance because it's about the factual basis of the case.

Paragraph 4: On September 21, 2015, the complaint was communicated to the Government, and the application was declared inadmissible. Here, the who is both the applicants (in terms of the complaint) and the Government. The event_what includes ""communicated... the complaint"" and ""declared inadmissible."" Since this is about actions taken by the Court, it's a procedural event.

I need to make sure each event is captured correctly, even if some don't have all three components but are still considered events based on the context. For example, in paragraph 3, the applicants' allegation might not have a specific date beyond the initial application, so Event_when could be omitted or noted as null.

Wait, I should check the instructions again: ""Events contain the annotations event_who, event_what and event_when. Events can be of type event_circumstance and event_procedure."" So each event must include all three, but perhaps in some cases, some are missing if not applicable.

But looking back, paragraph 3 doesn't have a date, so Event_when would be null or omitted. However, the task says to extract events where these can only appear within an event—so maybe we should only consider events that have all three components? Or is it acceptable to include some as missing?

The user also mentioned not to invent info, so I shouldn't create dates or other details not present.

So perhaps each paragraph can be split into multiple events if needed. Let me try to structure this:

1. Application event: applicants (who), lodged an application (what), Nov 4, 2010 (when). Procedural.
2. Representation event: applicants (who), represented by a lawyer (what), no date given. Maybe can't be classified without when? Or is it procedural without a date? Since it's ongoing, perhaps the date isn't needed for this specific event. But since Event_who and Event_what are present, maybe it's an event_procedure regardless of when.
3. Allegation event: applicants (who), alleged rights violation (what), no date. Maybe can't extract when, so perhaps classify as circumstance without when? Or is it necessary to omit the event?
4. Communication and inadmissibility event: complaint communicated (who?), Government (who), what includes communicating and declaring inadmissible, when Sept 21, 2015. Procedural.

Wait, in paragraph 4, the complaint was communicated to the Government and the application was declared inadmissible. So this is one event where Event_who could be the applicants (as the ones whose complaint is being handled) or perhaps the Court? Hmm, the text says ""the complaint... was communicated to the Government,"" so the subject is the complaint. But per definitions, Event_who can be a subject or object like an application. So maybe it's the complaint as the subject. Or perhaps the applicants.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me re-examine the user's examples: Event_who can be applicant, respondent, judge, witness. In paragraph 4, it's about the Government receiving communication and acting on the application. So the 'complaint' is an object, so the subject would be the applicants? Or perhaps the complaint itself is the who? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since it's the Court communicating to the Government, maybe the event_who refers to the applicants (the ones whose complaint is being processed) and the Government as another actor. But in terms of the main subject, perhaps it's better to focus on the applicants as the who.

Wait, no. The Court communicates the complaint to the Government, so the 'event' is about the communication. So Event_who would be the Government, but since we need three components, maybe:

- Event_who: Applicants (as those whose case is being processed)
- Event_what: Communicated... and declared inadmissible
- Event_when: September 21, 2015.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to consider each paragraph as separate events if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps each time a new action occurs, we can note an event. So:

1. The case originated in the application (event 1)
2. Applicants were represented (event 2)
3. They alleged a violation (event 3)
4. Complaint was communicated and application declared inadmissible (event 4)

Each of these would then be classified as either circumstance or procedure.

So, for event 1: procedural.

Event 2: procedural.

Event 3: since it's about the facts being judged, it's a circumstance.

Event 4: procedural because it's about the handling of the case.

I think this approach makes sense. So each paragraph can correspond to an event, with their respective classifications.

In terms of dates:

- Event 1: Nov 4, 2010
- Event 2: No date mentioned (maybe we have to note that as missing)
- Event 3: No specific date beyond the initial application; maybe not applicable
- Event 4: Sep 21, 2015

But since Event_who and Event_what must be present, even if when is missing for some events, perhaps they are still considered valid. Or perhaps we only include an event if all three are present.

Wait, the user's initial example says ""Events contain the annotations..."" implying each event must have them, but maybe in cases where information isn't available, it's omitted.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should treat each paragraph as one event. Let me try that:

Event 1: Applicants (who), lodged application (what), Nov 4, 2010 (when). Procedural.
Event 2: Applicants (who), represented by lawyer (what), no date given. Maybe can't classify without when? Or perhaps it's procedural as the action is ongoing.
Event 3: Applicants (who), alleged violation (what), no specific date beyond initial application. Since it's part of the case, but without a specific time after the application, maybe Event_who and Event_what are present, but Event_when isn't applicable here.
Event 4: Government (who), received communication (what?), Sept 21, 2015.

Wait, in paragraph 4, it's about the Court communicating to the Government. So perhaps:

- Event_who: Applicants (as the ones whose complaint is being processed)
- Event_what: The Court communicated the complaint and declared the application inadmissible.
- Event_when: September 21, 2015.

This way, each event includes all three components.

So maybe the events would be as follows:

1. Application Lodged
2. Representation by Lawyer
3. Allegation of Violation
4. Communication and Inadmissibility

Each with their respective who, what, when (where applicable), and classification.

Here is a structured breakdown of the identified events based on the analysis:

### Event 1: Application Lodged

- **Event_what**: Alleged a rights violation
- **Event_when**: No specific date mentioned beyond the initial application
- **Classification**: Circumstance (focuses on the facts being judged)

- **Event_who**: Applicants
- **Event_what**: The complaint was communicated to the Government, and the application was declared inadmissible
- **Event_when**: September 21, 2015

Okay, so I need to analyze the provided legal text and extract the events with their respective components: event_who, event_what, and event_when. Additionally, I have to classify each event into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

First, looking at paragraph 1:

""The case originated in an application (no. 35722/15) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Lidiya Pavlovna Sidorova (“the applicant”), on 2 July 2015.""

Here, the main event is an application. The subject (event_who) is Ms Lidiya Pavlovna Sidorova. The action taken (event_what) is ""lodged with the Court,"" and the date when this happened (event_when) is 2 July 2015.

Next, paragraph 2:

""The applicant was represented by Ms I. Kulakova, a lawyer practising in Dimitrovgrad. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, former Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.""

This paragraph talks about the representation. However, it doesn't directly mention an event related to the case's progression or procedural steps. It seems more about who was involved rather than what action was taken. So maybe there's no event here that needs extraction.

Now, paragraph 3:

""On 13 March 2017 notice of the complaint concerning the alleged interference with the applicant’s private life was given to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.""

Here, two events seem possible. First, the notice was given, which is an event. The subject (event_who) would be the applicant since they're the one complaining. The action (event_what) is ""given notice,"" and the date is 13 March 2017.

The second part mentions that the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible. So another event where the subject might still be the applicant, but now it's about their application being deemed inadmissible. The action is ""declared inadmissible"" by the Government, and the date remains 13 March 2017.

Wait, but since this is within the same paragraph, are these two separate events or part of the same? It seems like two separate actions: giving notice and declaring the application inadmissible.

So for each event:

First event:
- event_who: Ms Lidiya Pavlovna Sidorova (the applicant)
- event_what: gave notice
- event_when: 13 March 2017

Second event:
- event_who: Ms Lidiya Pavlovna Sidorova (the applicant)
- event_what: had her application declared inadmissible
- event_when: 13 March 2017

As for classification, both seem to be procedural events because they involve the progression of the case—notice given and application deemed inadmissible.

I think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The first paragraph was about the origin of the case through an application, which is a circumstance more than a procedure. But since it's the start, maybe it's both? Wait, the user said to classify into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. Since it's the initiation, perhaps it's an event_circumstance, but in paragraph 3, the events are procedural.

I need to make sure not to invent info, so I'll stick with what's there.

Wait, in paragraph 1, the application is the origin. So event_what is ""lodged,"" which is a procedure? Or maybe circumstance because it's the start of the case. Hmm. Maybe both, but the user wants only one classification. Let me check the examples: event_circumstance refers to facts under judgment and event_procedure refers to procedural steps.

So the application (paragraph 1) is a factual basis, so event_circumstance. The notice in paragraph 3 is definitely procedural as it's about the case processing.

Okay, I think that covers everything.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this legal text and extract the events properly. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the first paragraph: It talks about a case originating from an application numbered 32074/14 against Romania. The applicant is Ms. Luminița Zamfira Solcan, who lodged the application on April 17, 2014, under Article 34 of the Convention. So, the key elements here are the applicant and the action taken (lodging the application). This seems like an event where Event_who is the applicant, Event_what is ""lodge(d) an application,"" and Event_when is April 17, 2014.

Next, the second paragraph mentions representation: Ms. Diaconescu representing the applicant and Mr. Mocanu representing Romania's government. Here, both the applicant and the government are acting as event_who for their respective events. The verbs would be ""represented by,"" so Event_what could be ""represented."" However, since there isn't a specific action beyond representation, maybe it doesn't fit neatly into an event unless we consider each side's representation as separate events.

The third paragraph outlines the applicant's allegations, specifically a breach of Article 8 due to her inability to attend her mother’s funeral during hospitalization. This seems more like background information rather than an event with specific who, what, when elements. So perhaps this isn't classified under events but is just contextual.

Moving to the fourth paragraph: On September 1, 2015, notice of the complaint under Article 8 was given, and the rest of the application was declared inadmissible. Here, Event_who would be the Government, as they received the notice. The action taken (Event_what) is ""given notice,"" but since it's a complaint under Article 8, maybe the verb is ""declared inadmissible"" for Rule 54. So Event_what could be that declaration. Event_when is September 1, 2015.

I also need to classify these events into either event_circumstance or event_procedure. The first and fourth paragraphs seem procedural since they involve actions taken by the court or government, like lodging an application or declaring inadmissible. The second paragraph might be procedural as well, relating to the representation in court proceedings.

Wait, should I consider each mention of a legal action as a separate event? For example, both the initial application and the later notice of complaint could be events. Also, maybe the declaration of inadmissibility is another event with its own details.

I think I have four events here: one for the initial application, one for the notice of complaint, and two more if I split the representation into applicant and government actions. But maybe the representation isn't an event on its own since it's about who is doing what, not a specific action like lodging or declaring.

So, to sum up, the main events are:

1. Applicant lodging the application (event_circumstance).
2. Government receiving notice of complaint (event_procedure? Or maybe it's part of the procedural steps).
3. Application declared inadmissible (event_procedure).

I'm a bit unsure about classifying them correctly into circumstance or procedure, but I think event_circumstance refers to the main facts being adjudicated, like the breach of rights, while procedure relates to how the case is processed, like notifications and rulings.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to extract legal events from this text using the provided framework. Let's go through it step by step.

First, the task is to identify each event and then break down each into Event_who, Event_what, and Event_when. Additionally, I need to classify each event as either an event_circumstance or event_procedure.

Looking at paragraph 1: It mentions that the case originated from an application (numbered) by Mr. Ilie Stana against Romania. This seems like a legal action initiated by the applicant. So here, Event_who would be ""Mr. Ilie Stana,"" Event_what is ""lodged an application,"" and Event_when is ""8 October 2012."" Since this is about the filing of the case, it's related to the procedural aspect, so event_procedure.

Moving on to paragraph 2: It talks about representations by lawyers and the government. There are two mentions here. First, Mr. Bărăgan representing the applicant. That’s another instance where Event_who is ""Mr. A. Bărăgan,"" Event_what is ""represented"" (but we need a more specific action), maybe ""represented the applicant."" Event_when would be the date isn't provided, so perhaps it's just left as is. This seems procedural too.

The second mention in paragraph 2 is about the Romanian Government being represented by Ms. Brumar. So again, Event_who is ""Romanian Government,"" Event_what could be ""represented"" with an object like ""by their Agent."" No date here either. Another event_procedure.

Now, paragraph 3: This is crucial. It says that on a specific date, the Government was given notice of the complaint, and part of the application was declared inadmissible. So Event_who is ""Romanian Government,"" Event_what is ""given notice"" or perhaps more accurately ""notified about the complaint."" The date is 24 February 2016. This seems like a procedural event because it's about the court processing the case.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other events. Each time something happens, like someone taking action (applying, representing, being notified), that counts as an event with its own breakdown. I think I've covered all the key points here.

Alright, I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events. Let's start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

In paragraph 1, it mentions an application number 70288/13 against the Slovak Republic. The applicant is Mr. Stephan Visy from Austria who lodged the application on November 5, 2013. So here, the event_who is Mr. Visy, event_what is ""lodged an application,"" and event_when is November 5, 2013.

Moving to paragraph 2, the applicant's lawyer is mentioned as Mr. J. Čarnogurský, and the Slovak Government is represented by Ms. M. Pirošíková. This seems to be procedural since it's about who is representing whom in court. So this is another event: event_who includes both the applicant and the respondent, event_what is ""were represented,"" but I need to see if that fits into a procedure or circumstance.

Paragraph 3 details the allegations made by the applicant regarding the seizure of his information. This seems like the main event concerning the circumstances of the case. So here, event_who would be the applicant, event_what is ""alleged"" the re-seizure, and event_when isn't specified directly but is tied to March 7, 2012.

Paragraph 4 mentions that notice was given on November 10, 2016, and the Austrian Government didn't intervene. This looks like another procedural step: informing the parties. So event_who includes the applicant and respondent, event_what is ""given notice,"" and it's a procedural event.

I need to make sure each event has these components and classify them correctly as either circumstance or procedure. The first two events in paragraphs 1 and 2 seem mainly procedural, while paragraphs 3 is a circumstance regarding the applicant's claims, and paragraph 4 is another procedural step.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this legal text and extract the events as per the instructions. Let's start by understanding what each part requires.

First, the user provided a definition of legal events with categories: event_who, event_what, event_when, and classifications into event_circumstance or event_procedure. Each event must include these three elements and be categorized correctly.

Looking at the text provided in points 1 to 3, I need to identify each event. Let's go through each paragraph step by step.

Starting with point 1: It mentions an application (no. 15978/09) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention. The applicant is Mr. Igor Viktorovych Yakushev, and he did this on 7 March 2009. Here, the event seems to be about the filing of the application. So, who is involved? The applicant (event_who). What happened? The application was lodged (event_what), when? On 7 March 2009 (event_when). Since it's an action taken by the applicant against Ukraine, this is likely a procedural event because it's about initiating a case.

Moving to point 2: This discusses the representation of parties. The applicant has a lawyer, and the Government has an agent. I need to see if these are events. However, the main event here is the representation, but each party is being represented by someone. So, perhaps there are two separate events: one for the applicant's representation and another for the Government's. But since the point describes both, maybe they form part of a single procedural event where each side has their representatives.

Point 3: This mentions notice given on 9 December 2013 under Article 8 concerning the dismissal of the applicant’s paternity claim. The application was declared inadmissible under Rule 54 § 3. So here, who is involved? The Government received the notice (maybe the applicant as well). What happened? Notice of complaint and declaration of inadmissibility. When? On 9 December 2013. This seems like a procedural event as it's about case progression.

Now, for each identified event, I need to ensure all three elements are captured and classification is correct. I should also check if there are multiple events within a single paragraph.

I think point 1 is one event, points 2 might be two separate events (applicant's representation and Government's), but since it's in the same paragraph, perhaps they can be considered as part of a single procedural event. Point 3 is another event.

Wait, actually, each time a new action occurs, even within a single paragraph, it's a new event if it's a separate action. So point 1 is about lodging the application, which is one event. Then point 2 is about representation, so that's likely two events: one for the applicant and one for the Government. Point 3 is another event regarding notice and inadmissibility.

I need to structure this properly, making sure each event has its own who, what, when, and classification.

Note that there are no events classified as event_circumstance, as the text primarily describes procedural steps and actions taken by parties involved in the case. The events described are related to the progression of the case through the court system, rather than the underlying circumstances or facts of the case itself.","<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze this legal text and extract the events based on the provided definitions. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

First, in paragraph 1, it mentions that the case originated from an application (numbered 35237/14) against the Russian Federation. The applicant is Valentina Dmitriyevna Yermakovich, who filed the application with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention on March 12, 2015. So here, the event_who is the applicant, and event_what is ""lodged an application."" Since it's about submitting a case to the court, this seems like an event_circumstance because it's related to the circumstances under judgment.

Moving on to paragraph 2, it talks about the representatives of both parties. The applicant was represented by lawyers, while the Government had their own representatives. This doesn't seem to be an event since it's more about who is involved rather than a specific action or event.

Paragraph 3 mentions that on November 7, 2016, the Court communicated complaints regarding the applicant’s detention conditions and other issues, declaring part of the application inadmissible under Rule 54. Here, the event_who is the Court communicating with the Government. The main action is ""communicated complaints,"" so event_what would be that. Since this is about procedural actions within the case, it falls under event_procedure.

Paragraph 4 refers to September 6, 2018, when the parties were invited to submit further observations regarding the passport annulment. So again, the Court is inviting them to do something, which is another procedural action. Thus, event_who is the Court, event_what is ""invited to submit,"" and it's a procedural event.

Wait, in paragraph 3, when they say the applicant’s detention was communicated, does that count as an event? I think yes because there's a specific action taken by the Court regarding the applicant. So each time the Court acts on the case, it's a separate event with their own who, what, and when.

I should make sure not to miss any of these instances where the Court takes an action that constitutes an event. Each time they communicate something or invite submissions, that's another event.

So compiling all this, I have four events:

1. The applicant lodged an application on March 12, 2015.
2. The Court communicated complaints and declared inadmissibility on November 7, 2016.
3. The Court invited further observations on September 6, 2018.

Wait, but paragraph 4 is the invitation to submit further observations, so that's a separate event from the communication in paragraph 3. I need to list each as individual events with their respective who, what, and when.

Also, in paragraph 1, the application is clearly an event. So all four paragraphs contribute two or more events each.

I think that covers everything. Each time there's an action taken by a party related to the case, it's an event to extract.

Okay, I need to help analyze a legal text and extract events based on the given definitions. The user has provided four paragraphs from what seems like a court case decision or application. My task is to identify each event, classify them into either event_circumstance or event_procedure, and structure the output accordingly.

First, let me read through each paragraph carefully.

Paragraph 1: Talks about the origin of the case in an application (no. 66610/10) against the Russian Federation. The applicant is Mr. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich Zakharov who lodged the application on 16 October 2010 under Article 34 of the Convention. This sounds like the initiation of the case, so it's likely a procedural event.

Paragraph 2: Discusses that the applicant was granted leave to present his own case under Rule 36 § 2. The Government is represented by Mr. Matyushkin. This seems related to the procedural aspects, perhaps the preparation or handling of the case, so another procedural event.

Paragraph 3: The applicant alleges a violation of his right to respect for his home. This is more about the substance of the case, specifically the circumstances of the event, as it's the main issue being raised.

Paragraph 4: On 5 November 2015, the complaint was communicated to the Government and the remainder declared inadmissible under Rule 54 §3. This seems like a decision made by the court regarding the admissibility of the application, so another procedural event.

Now, I'll structure each event with who, what, when, and then classify them. Each sentence that mentions an event should be broken down into its components.
