    "procedure": "1.  The case originated in an application (no. 66640/12) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Ilie Stana (“the applicant”), on 8 October 2012.\n2.  The applicant was represented by Mr A. Bărăgan, a lawyer practising in Timişoara. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n3.  On 24 February 2016 the Government were given notice of the complaint concerning Article 8 of the Convention and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.",
    "circumstances": "4.  The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Timişoara.\n5.  On 20 February 2003 the applicant, a bank manager at that time, was placed in pre-trial detention by the Bucharest Anti-Corruption Department of the Prosecutor’s Office, on a charge of taking a bribe in order to favourably influence the acceptance of a loan requested by M.G.\n6.  By a final judgment delivered on 13 April 2012 the High Court of Cassation and Justice (“the High Court”) convicted the applicant of taking a bribe. Among the evidence which led to his conviction was the transcript of a phone conversation between the applicant and M.G. on 16 September 2002.\n7.  The conversation had been intercepted on the basis of a warrant issued by the prosecutor under the provisions of Law no. 51/1991 on national security (“Law no. 51/1991”) for the period between 13 August and 12 November 2002.\n8.  The applicant complained before the domestic courts about the lawfulness of the interception of his phone conversation and the accuracy of the transcript. He alleged that the Court had held that Law no. 51/1991 did not afford the guarantees required under Article 8 of the Convention. However, the High Court merely replied that the impugned interception had been lawful and within the scope of Law no. 51/1991.\nII.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n9.  The legislation in force at the relevant time concerning telephone tapping is described in Dumitru Popescu v. Romania (no. 2) (no. 71525/01, §§ 39-46, 26 April 2007).",
    "decision": "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,\n1.   Declares the application admissible;\n2.   Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n3.   Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n4.   Holds\n(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, EUR 118 (one hundred eighteen euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5.   Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 4 December 2018, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court."
